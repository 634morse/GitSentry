Will want to use entropy to be able measure the randomness of strings/data
  Strings with a hight entropy have a higher chance of being sensitive info as most tokens/keys/creds are created a random
  * Should have an entropy scoring system
  
Being that this is a tool for git repos the tool should be able to 
  - Download an individual repo
  - all repos in an organization or team
  - parse through histroric commits using "git log"
