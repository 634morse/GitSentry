# GitSentry

GitSentry is a tool written in GO that I plan on building to  
- scan code for sensitive information (tokens, creds, api keys, etc)
- enumerate Organizational settings
 - User rights
 - Repo branch protection settings
 - etc
 
Yes, there are tools out there to do this already (there almost always will be), but I am using this project to further my understandings within the security world, learn a new language, and new ways to think when working within Dev(Sec)Ops.
